// AMMDelete is a cleanup operation
// for AMMs that could not be fully deleted by AMMWithdraw due to too many trust
// lines (> ~512 LP token holders). In the simple 2-trust-line setup used here,
// AMMWithdraw TfWithdrawAll auto-deletes the AMM in a single transaction, so
// AMMDelete is never needed.
//
// Scenarios:
//   - not_empty: submit AMMDelete against a live (non-empty) AMM to confirm the
//     transaction is correctly rejected with tecAMM_NOT_EMPTY. This validates
//     the transaction type can be built, signed, and submitted, and that rippled
//     applies the right validation rule.
//
// NOTE: tesSUCCESS for AMMDelete requires an AMM that has been fully drained but
// still has ledger objects (trust lines) left over from a TfWithdrawAll that hit
// the per-transaction trust line deletion budget. Reproducing that condition needs
// 512+ LP token holders, which is impractical in a simple integration test.
